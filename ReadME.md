ABSTRACT

The MyLoc-Amenities Finder aims to help individuals who are new to a particular area become more familiar and comfortable with their surroundings. It accomplishes this by taking the user's location as an input and then identifying nearby facilities, which are classified into categories like food, shopping, medical, and grocery. The K-means clustering algorithm is used to create clusters of facilities within each category. Finally, these clusters are displayed on a map, providing a visual representation of the available amenities in the area.
